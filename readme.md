# GrailPay Bank-link Widget Example

In main.js you can see how to initialize the widget and how to handle the responses.
To test, edit main.js and replace the following lines with your own values.

```javascript  
const apiKey = '{your-api-key}';
const userId = '{your-user-id}';
const vendorId = '{your-vendor-id}';
```

apiKey and vendorId are supplied by GrailPay.
userId is the UUID of a user you have created using the register/person API endpoint.
